# Content Creator Workflow App - Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Content Creator Workflow App, including the approach, tools, and best practices for ensuring code quality and reliability.

## Testing Approach

The application follows a comprehensive testing approach with multiple layers:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components and functions in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between components and API endpoints
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Testing complete user flows and critical paths

## Testing Tools

- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components
- **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: For mocking API requests
- **Prisma Testing**: For database testing

## Test Organization

Tests are organized to mirror the application structure:

```
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── lib/
│   └── utils/
├── integration/
│   ├── api/
│   └── features/
└── e2e/
    └── flows/
```

## Testing Standards

### Unit Tests

- Each component should have corresponding unit tests
- Tests should verify:
  - Component rendering
  - State changes
  - Event handling
  - Prop validation
  - Conditional rendering

### Integration Tests

- API endpoints should have integration tests
- Tests should verify:
  - Request handling
  - Response structure
  - Error handling
  - Data persistence
  - Authentication and authorization

### End-to-End Tests

- Critical user flows should have E2E tests
- Tests should verify:
  - User authentication
  - Project creation and management
  - Task management
  - Asset upload and management
  - Calendar operations

## Test Coverage Goals

- Unit Tests: 80% coverage
- Integration Tests: 70% coverage
- E2E Tests: Cover all critical user flows

## Mocking Strategy

- External APIs (YouTube, Instagram) should be mocked
- Database operations should use a test database or be mocked
- File uploads should use mock storage

## CI/CD Integration

Tests will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Pre-commit**: Linting and unit tests
2. **Pull Request**: Unit and integration tests
3. **Merge to Main**: All tests including E2E

## Test Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Unit Testing Framework

- Set up Jest and React Testing Library
- Create test utilities and helpers
- Implement component tests for core UI elements

### Phase 2: API Testing

- Set up API testing infrastructure
- Implement tests for CRUD operations
- Test authentication flows

### Phase 3: E2E Testing

- Set up Cypress
- Implement tests for critical user flows
- Create test fixtures and mock data

## Best Practices

1. **Test Isolation**: Tests should not depend on each other
2. **Meaningful Assertions**: Test behavior, not implementation details
3. **Test Readability**: Tests should be easy to understand
4. **Fast Execution**: Tests should run quickly
5. **Deterministic Results**: Tests should produce the same results consistently

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## Test Maintenance

- Tests should be updated when features change
- Failed tests should be addressed immediately
- Test coverage should be monitored and maintained
- Test performance should be optimized regularly
